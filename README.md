🎯🛠️ ***Project: Image Classifier***
```
In the next few years software developers will need to know how to incorporate deep learning models into everyday applications. Any device with a camera will be using image classification, object detection and face recognition, all based on deep learning models.

In this project you will be implementing an image classification application. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then used the trained model to classify new images. First you will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook to ensure your training implementation works well. Afterwich you will convert your code into a python  application that you will be able run from the command line of your system
